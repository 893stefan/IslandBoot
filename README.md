# IslandBoot

IslandBoot is a minimal bootloader I'm developing to learn low-level programming and OS fundamentals.
The goal is to make it lightweight, universal, and to lay the groundwork for my own operating system project.

## Goals

- Learn how bootloaders work
- Practice x86 Assembly
- Lay the groundwork for a personal OS
